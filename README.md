# Sun Bathe and Touch Grass
If you're reading this as a developer you should probably find some time to go outside. This project was designed with the goal of helping shut-ins find the optimal time with their preferred weather to go outside to develop a healthy body. This project taught us how to utilize the *Next.js* framework, *client and server components*, and how to integrate a *Vercel PostgreSQL* database.

## Stack and Implementation
This project was built using the *Next.js* framework using *Typescript* (better for debugging vs JS), *PostgreSQL* for storing user time and weather preferences, and UI components from *React Suite* for ease of integration. The weather preferences were chosen based on the most common considerations for people wanting to go outside.

## Usage
This project is hosted at ***https://sun-bather.vercel.app/***. Click **"Get Started"** on the landing page to redirect to the home page. Go to the **"Preferences"** tab to enter your ideal outdoor weather (min/max temperature, intensity of sun, the presence of a breeze, and the presence of rain). Back at the **"Home"** tab, enter a ***CANADIAN CITY*** and click get weather then refresh to see if there is a recommended time to go outside based on your weather preferences!

## What's Next
We plan to incorporate the user's hourly availability for the day to determine whether or not a time can be recommended. We also want to implement a graphical representation of the weather conditions during a day.
